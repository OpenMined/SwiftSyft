# SwiftSyft

## Development

SwiftSyft's library structure was made using `pod lib create`. If you're not familiar with it, you can check out https://guides.cocoapods.org/making/using-pod-lib-create.

You can work on the project by running `pod install` in the `Example` folder. Then open the file `Example/SwiftSyft.xcworkspace`. When the project is open on Xcode, you can work on the `SwiftSyft` pod itself in `Pods/Development Pods/SwiftSyft/Classes/*`
